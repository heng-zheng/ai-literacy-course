# A Brief History of AI

AI has developed through several major phases, each shaped by different assumptions about how intelligence can be represented and reproduced in machines. These phases are often described as a progression from symbolic AI, to machine learning, and more recently to generative AI. While these stages overlap in practice, they provide a useful way to understand how ideas about AI have evolved over time.

AI has evolved through several major paradigms, each reflecting different assumptions about how intelligence can be modeled or simulated.

## Well-Known Milestones and Breakthroughs

Certain developments are often highlighted in popular and professional discussions of AI:
- The **Turing Test**, as a thought experiment about machine intelligence
- **Expert systems** used in fields like medicine and engineering
- The rise of **neural networks** and deep learning
- The emergence of **large language models** capable of writing, summarizing, and translating text

These milestones are important not only for technical reasons, but also because they influence how society understands and trusts AI systems.
