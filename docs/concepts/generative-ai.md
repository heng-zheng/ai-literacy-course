More recent systems focus on **generating new content**, including text, images, and code. Large language models (LLMs) are a prominent example. These systems:
- Learn from massive collections of existing content
- Generate outputs based on probability and patterns
- Interact with users through natural language

Each paradigm reflects different strengths, limitations, and assumptions about intelligence.
