# Machine Learning (Subsymbolic AI)
Later approaches shifted toward **learning patterns from data rather than encoding rules directly**. Key characteristics include:
- Statistical models trained on examples
- Performance that improves with more data
- Reduced reliance on human-crafted rules

This paradigm enabled advances in areas such as speech recognition, image classification, and recommendation systems.
