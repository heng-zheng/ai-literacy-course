# What Is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial intelligence does not have a single, universally agreed-upon definition. In general, AI refers to **computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence**, such as learning from experience, recognizing patterns, making decisions, or processing natural language.

Common misconceptions about AI include:
- AI is equivalent to human intelligence
- AI systems truly “understand” meaning in the same way humans do
- AI is always autonomous, intentional, or self-aware

In practice, most AI systems are **narrow and task-specific**. They operate within defined goals, data sources, and constraints, and their behavior is shaped by design choices made by humans.

## Everyday AI

AI is embedded in many routine information activities, often without being labeled as such. Examples include:
- Search engines and ranking algorithms
- Recommendation systems for media, shopping, and news
- Autocomplete, predictive text, and spelling correction
- Translation tools and conversational assistants

These systems shape what information is visible, how quickly it can be accessed, and how choices are presented to users.

## AI in Information Professions

In libraries, archives, and other information organizations, AI is increasingly used to support:
- Discovery systems and search interfaces
- Metadata creation and cataloging automation
- Knowledge organization and classification
- User analytics and service optimization

Rather than replacing professionals, these systems often **reconfigure workflows**, redistribute labor, and raise new questions about transparency, accountability, and professional judgment.

Understanding how AI functions in these contexts is an essential part of contemporary information literacy.
