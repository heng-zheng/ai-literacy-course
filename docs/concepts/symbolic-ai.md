# Symbolic AI
Early AI research emerged in the mid-20th century, most notably with the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence in 1956. Organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and others, this workshop formally introduced the term artificial intelligence and launched AI as a distinct research field.

Early symbolic AI assumed that intelligence could be modeled through explicit rules, logic, and symbolic representations of knowledge. Systems were built using:

- If–then rules
- Logical reasoning
- Expert systems
- Ontologies and taxonomies

These approaches proved effective in well-defined, structured domains, but struggled with ambiguity, uncertainty, and large-scale real-world data.
