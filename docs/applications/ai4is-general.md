# AI in Information Professions

In libraries, archives, and other information organizations, AI is increasingly used to support:
- Discovery systems and search interfaces
- Metadata creation and cataloging automation
- Knowledge organization and classification
- User analytics and service optimization

Rather than replacing professionals, these systems often **reconfigure workflows**, redistribute labor, and raise new questions about transparency, accountability, and professional judgment.

Understanding how AI functions in these contexts is an essential part of contemporary information literacy.
