# Everyday AI

人类对AI的使用并非现在才有，其实很早就开始了

AI is embedded in many routine information activities, often without being labeled as such. Examples include:
- Search engines and ranking algorithms
- Recommendation systems for media, shopping, and news
- Autocomplete, predictive text, and spelling correction
- Translation tools and conversational assistants

These systems shape what information is visible, how quickly it can be accessed, and how choices are presented to users.
